    Ruby 2.5 
    -------- 
    Ruby 2.5 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Ruby 2.5 applications and frameworks. Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text files and to do system management tasks (as in Perl). It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.
