Create a job which has 3 parallel jobs

I followed this link for this question
https://blog.openshift.com/openshift-jobs/
and 
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/dev_guide/jobs.html

The  above links says that using 
parallelism is an option to describe how many pods needs to be run at a time

oc create -f ques9job.yaml 
(This command will create a job pi)

oc describe job ques9job.yaml | grep parallelism (This command will describe how many pods can be run at a time)


So for running 3 pods at once, we will edit the yaml file and change the parallel:3. Now, this job will run 3 pods in parallel.
