Create a pod and create pvc for it and store some files in it

I didn't understood what you meant by store some files in it.

Followed this for assistant https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html#requesting-storage

oc login -u developer -p redhat
oc create project q8 (creating a project first)

Create a template for PersistentVolume with as 
kind:PersistentVolume
name: q8-pv

oc create -f q8-pv.yaml (this command will create a PV in our project) 

Create a template for PersistentVolume Claim
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
name:q8-pvc

oc create -f q8-pvc.yaml (this will create a PVC in our project)

Create a template for pod
kind: pod
name: q8-pod
provide the PersistentVolumeClaim that you just created in the yaml file so that this pod will use this PVC

oc create -f q8-pod.yaml (adding the yaml file to our project)

oc new-app --file q8-pod.yaml
