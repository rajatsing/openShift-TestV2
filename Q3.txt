Deploy beta4 branch of  https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world 

oc login -u developer -p redhat
oc new-project q3

oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world#beta4 

( Since I didn't knew to do it so I scrolled down this issue  and found the above command
https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/13933)

oc expose svc/ruby-hello-world --hostname=server.lab.rubyhelloworld (this command will expose the app on the given hostname)

You can expose the app using 
curl http://server.lab.rubyhelloworld
